To ensure that your connection to our HotelX API is set up correctly, youâ€™ll need to make
the following test scenario. You can choose the hotel and dates you prefer:
- **Case 1:** 1 room with 2 Adults for a Package rate rule.
- **Case 2:** 1 room with 2 Adults and 1 room with 2 adults + 1 Child 5 years old for a non-refundable rate.
- **Case 3:** 1 room with 2 Adults and 1 room with 2 adults + 1 Child 5 years old and 1 room for 3 adults for a refundable rate.
